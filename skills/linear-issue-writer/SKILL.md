# Linear issue writer

Create well-formed Linear issues whose goals are specified clearly enough that
`nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow` can plan implementation directly from them.

## CLI reference

`linear` is `joa23/linear-cli` (Go). Commands this skill uses:

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| List teams | `linear teams list` |
| List a team's projects | `linear projects list --team <KEY>` |
| Sanity-check a team key | `linear issues list --team <KEY> --limit 1` |
| Create an issue | `cat body.md \| linear issues create "<title>" --team <KEY> --project "<name>" --state Backlog -o json -d -` |
| Create a sub-issue | the same, plus `--parent <PARENT-ID>` |
| Replace a description | `cat body.md \| linear issues update <ID> -d -` |

The description arrives on **stdin**, and `-d -` is what makes the CLI read it —
a bare pipe leaves the description empty on `create` and dies on
`no updates specified` on `update`. There is no `--description-file`.

`-o json` returns the created issue including `.identifier` and `.url`; there is
no separate URL command (`linear issues get <ID> -o json` also carries `.url`
for an issue that already exists). The CLI is never interactive, so there
is no `--no-interactive` flag. States are the team's own **names**
(`linear teams states <KEY>`) — `Backlog`, not `backlog`.

## When this skill applies

The user wants to **create a new issue/task** and has **no existing issue ID**.
Triggers include Polish *utwórz / stwórz / dodaj / zgłoś / załóż issue / zadanie /
task* and English *create / open / file / new issue / task*.

**Disambiguation:** if the user gives an existing `TEAM-123` and asks to plan or
implement it → that is `nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow`, not this skill. This skill
*ends* by pointing at that one's status-driven flow.

## Hard gate (do not skip)

**No write to Linear** (`issue create`, sub-issues, labels) until the user has seen
the drafted issue body and approved it. Allowed before approval: `linear` read
commands, reading the repo/entity-page for context, asking clarifying questions,
drafting the issue text. The same gate applies to sub-issues proposed by a
grilling session (step 6).

## Grilling protocol (inline)

A grilling session interrogates the topic until shared understanding. Rules:

1. Interrogate every aspect of the topic until shared understanding is reached.
2. Walk down the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one
   branch at a time.
3. Ask **one question at a time** and wait for the answer.
4. Give a **recommended answer** with every question.
5. Verify facts yourself in the environment (code, repo, CLI) — ask the user
   only about **decisions**.
6. Do not act on the outcome until the user confirms shared understanding.

If `mattpocock-skills:grilling` is available in the session, you may use it for
question formats — the inline rules above always work without it (same graceful
degradation as external skill families elsewhere). Never delegate to the
`grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` wrappers: they carry
`disable-model-invocation: true` and only the user can run them, manually, as
slash commands.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve target team & project

Determine where the issue is filed, in this order, then **confirm with the user
before writing**:

1. **nerdbrain entity-page** — if the injected project page has `linear.team`
   and/or `linear.project`, use them.
2. **Git remote inference** — map the repo to a Linear team/project (e.g. via
   `linear issues list --team <key> --limit 1` to sanity-check the key exists).
3. **Ask** — if still unknown, list options (`linear teams list`,
   `linear projects list --team <key>`) and ask which team/project.

Show the resolved `team` + `project` and get a quick confirmation. This works in
repos without a wiki page (fall back to inference/ask).

### 2. Assess complexity (adaptive threshold)

Pick the path the same way every later adaptive choice is made:

| Signal | Path |
|--------|------|
| Single, clear, small task; user already stated the outcome | **Draft straight away**, minimal template (Objective + Acceptance criteria) |
| Vague, broad, or multi-part; outcome/criteria unclear | **Short interview first**, full template |

Run the interview per the **grilling protocol** above (no docs part at this
stage): one question at a time, a recommended answer with each, facts verified
yourself, only decisions asked. Cover only what is missing: objective,
problem/context, acceptance criteria, scope (in/out), constraints,
dependencies, open questions. Stop as soon as the goals are unambiguous — do
not interrogate a task that is already clear.

### 3. Decide decomposition

Default is a **checklist in the issue body** when the work has clear discrete steps.
Escalate to **real sub-issues** only when the topic plainly splits into stages.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear discrete steps within one deliverable | Implementation checklist in the description (default) |
| Topic plainly splits into stages/epics | **Propose** a parent + N child issues, each child with its own mini-template; create only after approval |
| User explicitly asks for sub-issues | Create sub-issues even if you would have used a checklist |
| User rejects sub-issues as too granular | Collapse the proposed children back into one issue + checklist |

When proposing sub-issues, present the split as a short list (each child's title +
one-line objective) and let the user accept, edit, or decline before any write.

### 4. Draft the issue body

Use the bundled `issue-template.md` (full variant for complex issues, minimal
variant for small ones). The sections mirror `linear-issue-workflow/plan-template.md`
so the planner knows exactly where to look. Match the issue language to the user /
repo (PL or EN).

`issue-template.md` is **generated** from the `IssueSpec` schema in
`workflow-graph.json` (`node scripts/render-templates.ts`); fix a section by
editing the schema, not the file. Filling it stays prose — nothing here asks you
or the user for JSON.

Write the body to a temp file and **show it to the user**. Wait for approval.

### 5. Create in Linear (always in Backlog)

New issues start in **Backlog** — pass the state explicitly so the team's
default state cannot override it:

```bash
cat <path> | linear issues create "<title>" \
  --team <key> --project "<name>" --state Backlog -o json -d -
```

For a parent + sub-issues, create the parent first, capture its `TEAM-123` ID from
the output, then create each child with `--parent`:

```bash
cat <parent.md> | linear issues create "<parent title>" \
  --team <key> --project "<name>" --state Backlog -o json -d -
# → read .identifier from the JSON, e.g. NER-123
cat <child-1.md> | linear issues create "<child title>" \
  --team <key> --project "<name>" --parent NER-123 --state Backlog -o json -d -
```

Add `-l/--labels`, `-p/--priority`, `-e/--estimate`, etc. only when the user
specified them — don't invent metadata. Priority takes a **name**
(`urgent|high|normal|low`, or `none`); prefer the name over the numeric 0–4
scale, whose meaning differs from the CLI this skill used previously.
`--parent` handles parent/child directly.

### 6. Grilling session (optional)

For a complex or still-fuzzy topic, ask the user: *Odpalić sesję grillowania
dla tego issue?* If yes, run it **inline** per the grilling protocol above
(no docs part in this skill), taking the created issue's body as the input.
Handle the outcome:

- sharpened requirements → update the issue description
  (`cat <path> | linear issues update <ID> -d -`) after showing the diff;
- the topic splits into stages → propose sub-issues (step 3 rules apply) and
  create them with `--parent <ID> --state Backlog` **only after the user approves
  the drafts** (hard gate above).

Skip the offer for a small, clear task — same adaptive threshold as step 2.

### 7. Output + handoff

Print the created issue ID(s) and URL(s) — both come from step 5's `-o json`
output (`.identifier` and `.url`); there is no URL command, though
`linear issues get <ID> -o json` also carries `.url` for an existing issue.
Then point at
the status-driven flow — do **not** offer to plan it yourself in this session:

> *Issue utworzone (NER-123) — w Backlogu. Wpisz ID issue w nowej sesji lub
> wiadomości, aby rozpocząć planowanie.*

Planning, implementation, and review are driven by the issue's Linear status in
`nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow` — keep creation and planning as separate,
deliberate steps.
