  Create a NEW Linear issue for the current repo/project with clearly specified

  issue/zadanie", "create issue", "new task") and does NOT yet have an issue ID.
  Adaptively interviews for missing goals, drafts the issue, gates the Linear write

# Linear issue writer

Create well-formed Linear issues whose goals are specified clearly enough that
`nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow` can plan implementation directly from them.

Use with the `linear-cli` skill for every `linear` command (flags, subcommands).

## When this skill applies

The user wants to **create a new issue/task** and has **no existing issue ID**.
Triggers include Polish *utwórz / stwórz / dodaj / zgłoś / załóż issue / zadanie /
task* and English *create / open / file / new issue / task*.

**Disambiguation:** if the user gives an existing `TEAM-123` and asks to plan or
implement it → that is `nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow`, not this skill. This skill
*ends* by optionally handing off to that one.

## Hard gate (do not skip)

**No write to Linear** (`issue create`, sub-issues, labels) until the user has seen
the drafted issue body and approved it. Allowed before approval: `linear` read
commands, reading the repo/entity-page for context, asking clarifying questions,
drafting the issue text.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve target team & project

Determine where the issue is filed, in this order, then **confirm with the user
before writing**:

1. **nerdbrain entity-page** — if the injected project page has `linear.team`
   and/or `linear.project`, use them.
2. **Git remote inference** — map the repo to a Linear team/project (e.g. via
   `linear issue query --team <key>` to sanity-check the key exists).
3. **Ask** — if still unknown, list options (`linear team list`,
   `linear project list`) and ask which team/project.

Show the resolved `team` + `project` and get a quick confirmation. This works in
repos without a wiki page (fall back to inference/ask).

### 2. Assess complexity (adaptive threshold)

Pick the path the same way every later adaptive choice is made:

| Signal | Path |
|--------|------|
| Single, clear, small task; user already stated the outcome | **Draft straight away**, minimal template (Objective + Acceptance criteria) |
| Vague, broad, or multi-part; outcome/criteria unclear | **Short interview first**, full template |

In the interview, ask **one question at a time**. Cover only what is missing:
objective, problem/context, acceptance criteria, scope (in/out), constraints,
dependencies, open questions. Stop as soon as the goals are unambiguous — do not
interrogate a task that is already clear.

### 3. Decide decomposition

Default is a **checklist in the issue body** when the work has clear discrete steps.
Escalate to **real sub-issues** only when the topic plainly splits into stages.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear discrete steps within one deliverable | Implementation checklist in the description (default) |
| Topic plainly splits into stages/epics | **Propose** a parent + N child issues, each child with its own mini-template; create only after approval |
| User explicitly asks for sub-issues | Create sub-issues even if you would have used a checklist |
| User rejects sub-issues as too granular | Collapse the proposed children back into one issue + checklist |

When proposing sub-issues, present the split as a short list (each child's title +
one-line objective) and let the user accept, edit, or decline before any write.

### 4. Draft the issue body

Use the bundled `issue-template.md` (full variant for complex issues, minimal
variant for small ones). The sections mirror `linear-issue-workflow/plan-template.md`
so the planner knows exactly where to look. Match the issue language to the user /
repo (PL or EN).

Write the body to a temp file and **show it to the user**. Wait for approval.

### 5. Create in Linear

For a single issue:

```bash
linear issue create --team <key> --project <name> \
  -t "<title>" --description-file <path> --no-interactive
```

For a parent + sub-issues, create the parent first, capture its `TEAM-123` ID from
the output, then create each child with `--parent`:

```bash
linear issue create --team <key> --project <name> \
  -t "<parent title>" --description-file <parent.md> --no-interactive
# → note the new ID, e.g. NER-123
linear issue create --team <key> --project <name> \
  -t "<child title>" --description-file <child-1.md> --parent NER-123 --no-interactive
```

Add `-l/--label`, `-p/--priority`, `--estimate`, etc. only when the user specified
them — don't invent metadata. (`linear` CLI supports `--parent`; no need for
`issue relation` for parent/child.)

### 6. Output + handoff

Print the created issue ID(s) and URL(s) (`linear issue url <ID>`). Then ask whether
to plan now:

> *Issue utworzone (NER-123). Zaplanować je od razu?*

If yes, hand off to **`nerd4rent:linear-issue-workflow`** with that ID. Do **not**
start planning or editing the repo on your own — keep creation and planning as
separate, deliberate steps.
