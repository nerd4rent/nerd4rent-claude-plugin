## Purpose

## Stack
- Language: ...
- Framework: ...
- DB / infra: ...
- Key libraries: ...

## Commands
- Build: `...`
- Test: `...`
- Run dev: `...`
- Deploy: `...`

## Conventions
Project-specific patterns not obvious from code.

## Gotchas
Foot-guns, surprising behavior, "looks like X but isn't".

## Decisions
- `YYYY-MM-DD` — decision + reason (+ Linear/issue link if applicable)

## Active context
What is happening now, deadlines, freeze windows, who to ask.
