# Issue writer

Create well-formed tracker issues whose goals are specified clearly enough that
`nerd4rent:issue-workflow` can plan implementation directly from them.

## Platform and adapters

Tracker commands live in an adapter file at the plugin root, never in this
skill. Run every operation by its ID from the adapter's `## Operations`
table; its `## CLI` section carries the command gotchas (multi-line bodies,
metadata flags), `## URL` how to build an issue link, and `## Statuses` the
state names:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/trackers/<tracker>.md
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` was not substituted, the plugin root is two
directories up from this skill's base directory.

## When this skill applies

The user wants to **create a new issue/task** and has **no existing issue ID**.
Triggers include Polish *utwórz / stwórz / dodaj / zgłoś / załóż issue / zadanie /
task* and English *create / open / file / new issue / task*.

**Disambiguation:** if the user gives an existing issue ID (`TEAM-123`, or
`#123` / `owner/repo#123` on GitHub Issues, `#123` / `group/project#123` on
GitLab Issues, `#123` / `AB#123` on Azure DevOps Boards) and asks to plan or implement it → that is `nerd4rent:issue-workflow`, not this skill. This skill
*ends* by pointing at that one's status-driven flow.

## Hard gate (do not skip)

**No write to the tracker** (`issue.create`, sub-issues, labels) until the user has seen
the drafted issue body and approved it. Allowed before approval: tracker read
operations, reading the repo/entity-page for context, asking clarifying questions,
drafting the issue text. The same gate applies to sub-issues proposed by a
grilling session (step 6).

## Grilling protocol (inline)

A grilling session interrogates the topic until shared understanding. Rules:

1. Interrogate every aspect of the topic until shared understanding is reached.
2. Walk down the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one
   branch at a time.
3. Ask **one question at a time** and wait for the answer.
4. Give a **recommended answer** with every question.
5. Verify facts yourself in the environment (code, repo, CLI) — ask the user
   only about **decisions**.
6. Do not act on the outcome until the user confirms shared understanding.

If `mattpocock-skills:grilling` is available in the session, you may use it for
question formats — the inline rules above always work without it (same graceful
degradation as external skill families elsewhere). Never delegate to the
`grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` wrappers: they carry
`disable-model-invocation: true` and only the user can run them, manually, as
slash commands.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the platform, then the target team & project

**Platform first.** Take the tracker and its identifiers from the first source
that has them:

1. the `## Platform` section of the repo `CLAUDE.md`;
2. the entity page frontmatter `platform:` — a legacy `linear:` block there
   means `tracker: linear` with that `team` and `project`;
3. neither → **invoke `nerd4rent:determine-platform`** and take the platform
   from its output.

No adapter file for the tracker → stop and report: "adapter
`trackers/<tracker>` is not available yet in this plugin version" — never
fall back to another tracker.

**Then the target.** Use the config's identifiers (for Linear: `team` key and
`project`). When the config names none, list options (`team.list`,
`project.list` filtered by team) and ask; sanity-check a typed team key with
`team.check`. Show the resolved `team` + `project` and get a quick
confirmation **before writing**.

When the adapter lists `team.*` and `project.*` as `—` (GitHub Issues,
GitLab Issues), the repo is the container: take it from the config's `github`
block (`owner/repo`) or `gitlab` block (`group/project`), skip the team and
project questions, and confirm the repo instead.

On Azure DevOps Boards (`tracker: ado`) the project is the container and the
issue is a work item of type `ado.workItemType`, created on `ado.team`'s board:
take all of them from the `ado` block and confirm project + type. When the
block has no `workItemType`, stop and run `nerd4rent:bind-statuses` first — it
picks the team, board and type — never guess a type. Sub-issues are the same
type with a parent link, so they land on the same board.

### 2. Assess complexity (adaptive threshold)

Pick the path the same way every later adaptive choice is made:

| Signal | Path |
|--------|------|
| Single, clear, small task; user already stated the outcome | **Draft straight away**, minimal template (Objective + Acceptance criteria) |
| Vague, broad, or multi-part; outcome/criteria unclear | **Short interview first**, full template |

Run the interview per the **grilling protocol** above (no docs part at this
stage): one question at a time, a recommended answer with each, facts verified
yourself, only decisions asked. Cover only what is missing: objective,
problem/context, acceptance criteria, scope (in/out), constraints,
dependencies, open questions. Stop as soon as the goals are unambiguous — do
not interrogate a task that is already clear.

### 3. Decide decomposition

Default is a **checklist in the issue body** when the work has clear discrete steps.
Escalate to **real sub-issues** only when the topic plainly splits into stages.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear discrete steps within one deliverable | Implementation checklist in the description (default) |
| Topic plainly splits into stages/epics | **Propose** a parent + N child issues, each child with its own mini-template; create only after approval |
| User explicitly asks for sub-issues | Create sub-issues even if you would have used a checklist |
| User rejects sub-issues as too granular | Collapse the proposed children back into one issue + checklist |

When proposing sub-issues, present the split as a short list (each child's title +
one-line objective) and let the user accept, edit, or decline before any write.

### 4. Draft the issue body

Use the bundled `issue-template.md` (full variant for complex issues, minimal
variant for small ones). The sections mirror `issue-workflow/plan-template.md`
so the planner knows exactly where to look. Match the issue language to the user /
repo (PL or EN).

`issue-template.md` is **generated** from the `IssueSpec` schema in
`workflow-graph.json` (`node scripts/render-templates.ts`); fix a section by
editing the schema, not the file. Filling it stays prose — nothing here asks you
or the user for JSON.

Write the body to a temp file and **show it to the user**. Wait for approval.

### 5. Create on the tracker (always in the backlog phase)

New issues start in the **`backlog`** phase — run `issue.create` with the
title, the resolved container and the approved body file; the adapter's notes
say how the backlog phase is written (on Linear the state is passed
explicitly so the team's default cannot override it).

For a parent + sub-issues, create the parent first with `issue.create`,
capture its ID (`TEAM-123`, `#123`) as the operation's notes describe, then create each child with
`issue.create-child`, passing that ID as the parent.

Add labels, priority or estimate only when the user specified them — don't
invent metadata; the adapter's `## CLI` section lists the flags and their
quirks.

### 6. Grilling session (optional)

For a complex or still-fuzzy topic, ask the user: *Odpalić sesję grillowania
dla tego issue?* If yes, run it **inline** per the grilling protocol above
(no docs part in this skill), taking the created issue's body as the input.
Handle the outcome:

- sharpened requirements → update the issue description
  (`issue.update-description`) after showing the diff;
- the topic splits into stages → propose sub-issues (step 3 rules apply) and
  create them with `issue.create-child` under `<ID>` **only after the user
  approves the drafts** (hard gate above).

Skip the offer for a small, clear task — same adaptive threshold as step 2.

### 7. Output + handoff

Print the created issue ID(s) — as step 5 captured them — and, when a
link helps, build the URL per the adapter's `## URL` section. Then point at
the status-driven flow — do **not** offer to plan it yourself in this session:

> *Issue utworzone (NER-123) — w Backlogu. Wpisz ID issue w nowej sesji lub
> wiadomości, aby rozpocząć planowanie.*

Planning, implementation, and review are driven by the issue's phase on the tracker in
`nerd4rent:issue-workflow` — keep creation and planning as separate,
deliberate steps.
