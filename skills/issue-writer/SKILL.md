# Issue writer

Create well-formed tracker issues whose goals are specified clearly enough that
`nerd4rent:issue-workflow` can plan implementation directly from them.

## Platform and adapters

Tracker commands live in an adapter file at the plugin root, never in this
skill. Run every operation by its ID from the adapter's `## Operations`
table; its `## CLI` section carries the command gotchas (multi-line bodies,
metadata flags), `## URL` the recipe behind `issue.url`, and `## Statuses` the
state names:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/trackers/<tracker>.md
```

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` was not substituted, the plugin root is two
directories up from this skill's base directory.

## When this skill applies

The user wants to **create a new issue/task** and has **no existing issue ID**.
Triggers include Polish *utwórz / stwórz / dodaj / zgłoś / załóż issue / zadanie /
task* and English *create / open / file / new issue / task*.

**Disambiguation:** if the user gives an existing issue ID (`TEAM-123`, or
`#123` / `owner/repo#123` on GitHub Issues, `#123` / `group/project#123` on
GitLab Issues, `#123` / `AB#123` on Azure DevOps Boards) and asks to plan or implement it → that is `nerd4rent:issue-workflow`, not this skill. This skill
*ends* by pointing at that one's status-driven flow.

## Hard gate (do not skip)

**No write to the tracker** (`issue.create`, sub-issues, labels) until the user has seen
the drafted issue body and approved it. Allowed before approval: tracker read
operations, reading the repo/entity-page for context, asking clarifying questions,
drafting the issue text. The same gate applies to sub-issues proposed by a
grilling session (step 6).

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the platform, then the target team & project

**Platform first.** Take the tracker and its identifiers from the first source
that has them:

1. the `## Platform` section of the repo `CLAUDE.md`, read from disk as
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/platform.md` describes, never from context;
2. the entity page frontmatter `platform:` — a legacy `linear:` block there
   means `tracker: linear` with that `team` and `project`;
3. neither → **invoke `nerd4rent:determine-platform`** and take the platform
   from its output.

No adapter file for the tracker → stop and report: "adapter
`trackers/<tracker>` is not available yet in this plugin version" — never
fall back to another tracker.

**Then the target.** Use the config's identifiers (for Linear: `team` key and
`project`). When the config names none, list options (`team.list`,
`project.list` filtered by team) and ask; sanity-check a typed team key with
`team.check`. Show the resolved `team` + `project` and get a quick
confirmation **before writing**.

When the adapter lists `team.*` and `project.*` as `—` (GitHub Issues,
GitLab Issues), the repo is the container: take it from the config's `github`
block (`owner/repo`) or `gitlab` block (`group/project`), skip the team and
project questions, and confirm the repo instead.

On Azure DevOps Boards (`tracker: ado`) the project is the container and the
issue is a work item of type `ado.workItemType`, created on `ado.team`'s board:
take all of them from the `ado` block and confirm project + type. When the
block has no `workItemType`, stop and run `nerd4rent:bind-statuses` first — it
picks the team, board and type — never guess a type. Sub-issues are the same
type with a parent link, so they land on the same board.

### 2. Assess complexity (out loud)

Invoke **`nerd4rent:grill`** with the two argument lines `issue: none` and
`topic: the user's request`. It says the size of the topic out loud before any
question, so the user can override it, and the size picks the path:

| Size the skill announces | Path |
|--------|------|
| **small** — one clear deliverable, outcome already stated | the skill returns at once: **draft straight away**, minimal template (Objective + Acceptance criteria) |
| **medium** — one piece of work with open decisions | the skill interviews in rounds; draft with the full template from its confirmed outcome |
| **large** — plainly splits into stages | the outcome proposes the split, named as a result split or as stages in time; step 3 turns it into issues |

The decisions the interview settles are the template's sections the request
leaves open: objective, problem/context, acceptance criteria, scope (in/out),
constraints, dependencies, open questions. Facts about the repo are checked by
the skill, not asked. A decision the outcome tags **glossary term** becomes an
acceptance criterion of the drafted issue: "`CONTEXT.md ## Language` has the
term `<Term>` — check: `node scripts/validate-context-terms.ts`"; the entry
itself is written when the issue is implemented.

### 3. Decide decomposition

Default is a **checklist in the issue body** when the work has clear discrete steps.
Escalate to **separate issues** only when the topic plainly splits into parts
of one result or into stages in time.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear discrete steps within one deliverable | Implementation checklist in the description (default) |
| Topic splits into parts of one result | **Result split**: propose a parent + N child issues, each child with its own mini-template; create only after approval |
| Topic splits into stages that follow one another in time | **Stages in time**: propose N sibling issues under one epic, each stage after the first blocked by the one before; create only after approval |
| User explicitly asks for sub-issues | Create sub-issues even if you would have used a checklist |
| User rejects sub-issues as too granular | Collapse the proposed children back into one issue + checklist |

The two splits differ in what closing means. A **result split** is one
deliverable in parts: the children together are the parent's result, and the
parent closes once every child is done. **Stages in time** are separate
deliverables, each shipping on its own: stage 2 starts after stage 1 is done,
and closing stage 1 must leave stage 2 open. A stage is therefore never a
child of the stage before it. The stages are siblings: children of a shared
epic (the parent the user names, the parent of the issue being split, or a
new epic issue proposed with them), else top-level issues of the project.
The order is a `blocked by` relation from each stage to the one before.

When proposing a split, name its kind first (*podział rezultatu* or *etapy w
czasie*, in the issue's language) with the one-sentence reason, then present
it as a short list (each issue's title + one-line objective, and for stages
the issue it is blocked by), and let the user accept, edit, or decline before
any write.

### 4. Draft the issue body

Use the bundled `issue-template.md` (full variant for complex issues, minimal
variant for small ones). The sections mirror `issue-workflow/plan-template.md`
so the planner knows exactly where to look. Match the issue language to the user /
repo (PL or EN).

`issue-template.md` is **generated** from the `IssueSpec` schema in
`workflow-graph.json` (`node scripts/render-templates.ts`); fix a section by
editing the schema, not the file. Filling it stays prose — nothing here asks you
or the user for JSON.

Write the body to a temp file and **show it to the user**. Wait for approval.

### 5. Create on the tracker (always in the backlog phase)

New issues start in the **`backlog`** phase — run `issue.create` with the
title, the resolved container and the approved body file; the adapter's notes
say how the backlog phase is written (on Linear the state is passed
explicitly so the team's default cannot override it).

For a parent + sub-issues, create the parent first with `issue.create`,
capture its ID (`TEAM-123`, `#123`) as the operation's notes describe, then create each child with
`issue.create-child`, passing that ID as the parent.

For stages in time, create the epic first when it is new, then each stage in
order: under the epic with `issue.create-child`, or with `issue.create` when
there is none. After each stage but the first, run `issue.add-blocked-by`
with the new stage as the blocked issue and the stage before it as the
blocker.

Add labels, priority or estimate only when the user specified them — don't
invent metadata; the adapter's `## CLI` section lists the flags and their
quirks.

**A bug report.** When the input is an incident handed over by another skill
(an issue found in the wrong phase, the rule *A done issue without a trace of
work* in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/statuses.md`), the bug marking and
the relation count as specified. The draft names both: the marking from the
tracker adapter's `## Bugs`, and a `related` relation to the faulty issue.
The body describes the incident (what was found, how, the faulty issue's
link and phase, the expected state); the unfinished work goes into the same
body or into child issues proposed under step 3. After approval, run
`issue.create` with the marking, then `issue.relate` from the new bug to the
faulty issue. The faulty issue itself is not edited: no comment in place of
the bug, no change of its phase.

### 6. Grilling session (optional)

For a complex or still-fuzzy topic, ask the user: *Odpalić sesję grillowania
dla tego issue?* If yes, invoke **`nerd4rent:grill`** with `issue: <ID>` (the
issue step 5 created) and `topic: the created issue's body`; the skill records
its state as comments on that issue, so the session can resume on another
machine. Handle the confirmed outcome:

- sharpened requirements → update the issue description
  (`issue.update-description`) after showing the diff;
- a decision tagged **glossary term** → the same acceptance criterion as in
  step 2 ("`CONTEXT.md ## Language` has the term `<Term>` — check:
  `node scripts/validate-context-terms.ts`"), added to the description in
  that update;
- the topic splits → propose the split of the kind the outcome named (step 3
  rules apply) and create it **only after the user approves the drafts**
  (hard gate above): a result split as children of `<ID>` with
  `issue.create-child`; stages in time with `<ID>` as the first stage and
  the later stages as its siblings (under its parent with
  `issue.create-child`, else with `issue.create`), each blocked by the one
  before through `issue.add-blocked-by`.

Skip the offer when step 2 classified the topic as small.

### 7. Output + handoff

Print the created issue ID(s) — as step 5 captured them — each with its link
from `issue.url`, in the shape *Asking the human to move a phase* in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/adapters/statuses.md` gives. Then point at the
status-driven flow — do **not** offer to plan it yourself in this session:

> *Issue utworzone (NER-123) — w Backlogu: <link>. Wpisz ID issue w nowej
> sesji lub wiadomości, aby rozpocząć planowanie.*

Planning, implementation, and review are driven by the issue's phase on the tracker in
`nerd4rent:issue-workflow` — keep creation and planning as separate,
deliberate steps.
