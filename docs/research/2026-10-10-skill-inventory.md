# Research: skill inventory for the whole issue lifecycle

Checked on 2026-10-10 on the author's machine, against the repository at `main` `5b1ddf5` (0.51.0). The earlier research answered narrower questions: `2026-10-06-sdd-patterns.md` (section "Practice decisions") rated the nine practices the plugin borrowed from superpowers and Matt Pocock, and `2026-10-08-framework-independence-review.md` checked that the repository no longer calls them. Neither asked what the framework needs across the whole lifecycle, skill by skill. This document does: every practice of the lifecycle gets a verdict, every installed skill is mapped to a practice or marked off-cycle, and every gap names the issue that closes it.

## 1. Verdict

The plugin covers the lifecycle end to end except for nine practices:

| Gap | Issue |
|---|---|
| Debugging (`debug`) | NER-405 |
| Parallel subagent dispatch (`dispatch-agents`) | NER-405 |
| Domain modelling (`model-domain`) | NER-405 |
| Splitting work into stages with blocking edges | NER-407 |
| Receiving review comments from people and bots on the PR or MR | NER-414 |
| PR or MR body written for human reviewers | NER-410 |
| Session retrospective that turns lessons into issues | NER-411 |
| Testing skills: an eval runner and coverage of the core skills | NER-412 |
| Detecting a stale plugin install or stale skill copies | NER-413 |

Everything else is either covered by a plugin skill (`mamy` below, "have"), or deliberately left out (`skip`) with the reason in the row. No practice is a thin overlay: the two candidates, worktrees and skill authoring, are served by host built-ins that need no plugin context around them, so an overlay would add text without solving a problem.

Once the gaps above are closed, nothing in superpowers or Matt Pocock's library is needed by the plugin's flow. Disabling superpowers on this machine stays a separate, manual step (out of scope here).

## 2. Sources

Generated, not recalled. The command below lists every skill this document maps in table B; its output on 2026-10-10 was 157 lines.

| Source | Host that loads it | Revision | Skills |
|---|---|---|---|
| superpowers | Claude Code (enabled) | 6.2.0 | 14 |
| superpowers-developing-for-claude-code | Claude Code (installed, disabled) | 0.3.1 | 4 |
| superpowers-lab | Claude Code (installed, disabled) | 0.5.0 | 4 |
| superpowers-chrome | Claude Code (installed, disabled) | 3.0.1 | 1 |

| pstack | Cursor (`cursor-public`) | `d0ef80d` | 54 |
| `~/.agents/skills` | Cursor (user-level skills directory) | not versioned | 39 |

The other installed plugins get one row each. They were listed with:

```bash
for host in claude cursor; do
  for dir in ~/."$host"/plugins/cache/*/*/; do
    marketplace=$(basename "$(dirname "$dir")"); plugin=$(basename "$dir")
    case "$marketplace/$plugin" in superpowers-marketplace/*|mattpocock/*|cursor-public/pstack|nerd4rent-claude-plugin/nerd4rent) continue;; esac
    printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$host" "$marketplace" "$plugin" "$(find "$dir" -name SKILL.md | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
  done
done
```

| Host | Plugin | Skills | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `anthropic-agent-skills` (`claude-api`, `document-skills`, `example-skills`, all disabled) | 18 each, one shared tree | off-cycle: document formats and API reference; its `skill-creator` is counted under A33 |
| Claude Code | `linear-skills/gitlab-to-linear` | 1 | off-cycle: one-off GitLab import, a separate flow |
| Claude Code | `linear-skills/linear-cli` | 1 | off-cycle: the Linear adapter calls `linearis` directly |
| Claude Code | `claude-code-warp`, `gitkraken-hooks` | 0 | off-cycle: terminal and git client integration |
| Cursor | `claude-plugins-official` (github, linear, eight LSP plugins) | 0 | off-cycle: MCP servers and language servers |
| Cursor | `cursor-public` (1password, context7, google-drive, slack, gmail, google-calendar, outlook, linear, wispr-flow) | 11 in total | off-cycle: service connectors |

Host built-ins that touch the lifecycle were taken from the Claude Code session's command list and from Cursor's documentation (skills, modes, Bugbot, worktrees pages, read 2026-10-10):

- Claude Code: plan mode, worktrees (`EnterWorktree`, `--worktree`), `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`, `/init`, the `skill-creator` skill, `claude plugin eval`.
- Cursor: Plan Mode, Debug Mode (hypotheses plus instrumentation logs, removed after the fix), `/review` and `/review-bugbot` (local Bugbot run against the base branch), Bugbot on PRs, `/worktree` and `/best-of-n`, `/create-skill`.

One fact from Cursor's skills page matters below: Cursor loads user-level skills from `~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`. Claude Code does not read `~/.agents/skills`.

## 3. Lifecycle (table A)

Verdicts: **have** (`nerd4rent:<skill>` covers it), **missing** (no owner in the plugin; the issue column names the fix), **thin overlay** (a plugin wrapper around a host built-in, never around another plugin, since ADR-0009 forbids that reference), **skip** (deliberately left out, reason given).

| Id | Phase | Practice | Sources | Verdict | Reason | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Project bootstrap | Repository, tracker project and wiki page in one run | `/init` (Claude Code) | have `new-project-workflow` | The flow needs the tracker project and the wiki page, which `/init` does not create | |
| A2 | Project bootstrap | Platform config and status binding | Matt Pocock `setup-matt-pocock-skills` | have `determine-platform`, `bind-statuses` | Same idea as Matt Pocock's setup, recorded in the repo `CLAUDE.md` where every skill reads it | |
| A3 | Project bootstrap | Machine CLI state | none | have `bootstrap-clis` | | |
| A4 | Project bootstrap | Repository guardrails: pre-commit hooks, git safety hooks, module boundary checks | Matt Pocock `setup-pre-commit`, `git-guardrails-claude-code`, `setup-ts-deep-modules` | skip | Tooling choices of each repository; client repositories have their own, and the plugin does not install tooling into them | |
| A5 | Project bootstrap | Detecting a stale plugin install or stale skill copies | the four stale copies in `~/.agents/skills` | missing | See section 5: on 2026-10-10 Claude Code ran 0.45.0 against 0.51.0 on `main`, and Cursor loads June copies of four plugin skills next to the plugin, with no signal in either case | NER-413 |
| A6 | Issue and spec | Issue with a spec: objective, scope, criteria that name their check | Matt Pocock `to-spec`, `to-prd`, `request-refactor-plan` | have `issue-writer` | The spec lives on the tracker (ADR-0008); Matt Pocock's synthesis without interview is the minimal path of `issue-writer` | |
| A7 | Issue and spec | Splitting work into stages or sub-issues with blocking edges | Matt Pocock `to-tickets`, `to-issues` | missing | `issue-writer` only knows parent and children; stages in time need siblings with `blocked by`, and the adapters have no relation operation | NER-407 |
| A8 | Issue and spec | Triage of inbound bug reports, QA session filing issues | Matt Pocock `triage`, `qa`; pstack `triage-issue-reports`, `reproduce-and-fix-issues`, `setup-benny` | skip | No inbound report stream: issues are written by the developer with `issue-writer`; the automations write to the tracker without a human gate | |
| A9 | Issue and spec | Map of work larger than one session | Matt Pocock `wayfinder`; pstack `figure-it-out` | skip | An epic with sibling issues (A7) is the map; each issue is one session's worth | |
| A10 | Grilling | Interview in rounds until shared understanding | Matt Pocock `grilling`, `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `batch-grill-me`; superpowers `brainstorming` | have `grill` | Rounds over the frontier, size said out loud, state as tracker comments | |
| A11 | Grilling | Questionnaire for a decision someone else answers | Matt Pocock `to-questionnaire` | skip | Rare; a tracker comment addressed to that person does the same | |
| A12 | Domain modelling | Glossary and ADR discipline | Matt Pocock `domain-modeling`, `ubiquitous-language` | missing | Planned since 2026-10-06 and never written | NER-405 |
| A13 | Domain modelling | Module and interface design, prototypes before code | Matt Pocock `codebase-design`, `design-an-interface`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `prototype`; pstack `architect`, `principle-exhaust-the-design-space`, `principle-model-the-domain` | skip | The plan's Technical Approach is where the design is decided and reviewed; deep-module vocabulary is a repository standard, not a lifecycle step | |
| A14 | Plan | Implementation plan on the tracker, built from parallel context gathering | superpowers `writing-plans`; pstack `principle-sequence-verifiable-units`; Plan Mode in both hosts | have `issue-workflow`, `plan-context-fanout` | The host plan modes keep the plan in the chat; ours lives on the issue so another machine can resume it | |
| A15 | Plan execution | Sequential execution under phase gates | superpowers `executing-plans`; Matt Pocock `implement` | have `issue-workflow`, `issue-start` | | |
| A16 | Plan execution | Parallel subagent dispatch | superpowers `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `subagent-driven-development`; pstack `swarm`, `arena`, `principle-guard-the-context-window`, `principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state`; Cursor `/best-of-n` | missing | The islands fan out inside fixed nodes; ad hoc dispatch (independence test, self-contained prompt, diff as evidence) has no owner | NER-405 |
| A17 | Plan execution | Worktree isolation | superpowers `using-git-worktrees`; Claude Code worktrees; Cursor `/worktree` | skip | Both hosts ship worktrees as built-ins; one issue runs on one branch in one checkout, and nothing in the flow needs plugin context around a worktree | |
| A18 | Plan execution | Autonomous run of a whole issue | none | have `auto-issue-mode` | | |
| A19 | Plan execution | Resume and hand-off across sessions and machines | Matt Pocock `handoff`, `claude-handoff`; pstack `recall` | have `project-continue` plus the session summary | The tracker comment and the `## Checkpoints` entry are the hand-off document | |
| A20 | TDD | Test-first loop with a recorded exit | superpowers `test-driven-development`; Matt Pocock `tdd`; pstack `tdd`, `principle-test-behavior-not-implementation` | have `tdd` | | |
| A21 | Debugging | Feedback loop, ranked hypotheses, root cause before the fix | superpowers `systematic-debugging`; Matt Pocock `diagnosing-bugs` (and `diagnose` in `~/.agents/skills`); pstack `principle-fix-root-causes`, `principle-attack-the-premise`, the `poteto-mode` bug-fix playbook; Cursor Debug Mode | missing | Cursor's Debug Mode covers the same loop on one host only; Claude Code has none | NER-405 |
| A22 | Verification | Evidence before claiming done | superpowers `verification-before-completion`; pstack `principle-prove-it-works` | have `tdd` (check beat) and the criteria verification table of `issue-workflow` | | |
| A23 | Verification | Driving the running application as a user would | pstack `create-verification-skill`, `maintain-verification-skill` | skip | The plugin has no running application; a project that has one writes its own verification skill | |
| A24 | Review (request) | Independent review axes, adversarial verification | superpowers `requesting-code-review`; Matt Pocock `code-review`; pstack `interrogate`, `no-comments`; `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`; Cursor `/review`, Bugbot | have `review-verify` | The built-ins stay available by hand; the flow uses the island because its findings are verified and counted | |
| A25 | Review (receive) | Acting on review comments that people or bots leave on the PR or MR | superpowers `receiving-code-review`; Cursor Bugbot comments | missing | The island's findings are verified before they are fixed, but comments left on the PR or MR by colleagues (the only reviewers on client repositories) or by Bugbot are never read: the VCS adapters have no operation for them | NER-414 |
| A26 | Finishing a branch | Merge through the PR with a merge commit, switch to base | superpowers `finishing-a-development-branch` | have `issue-close` | | |
| A27 | Finishing a branch | PR or MR body written for human reviewers | pstack `blast-radius` | missing | The draft body is `Fixes <ID>` plus one paragraph; on client repositories it is the only text other developers read | NER-410 |
| A28 | Finishing a branch | Resolving merge conflicts | Matt Pocock `resolving-merge-conflicts` | skip | `issue-close` stops and reports; each conflict is resolved with the user, case by case | |
| A29 | Close-out | Issue to done, base branch checked out | none | have `issue-close` | The check for unfinished children is NER-406, a refinement of this row | |
| A30 | Wiki and memory | Project entity page, decisions, checkpoints | Matt Pocock `obsidian-vault`; `obsidian-markdown` in `~/.agents/skills` | have `nerdbrain-wiki`, `nerdbrain-search` | `nerdbrain-wiki` names `obsidian-markdown` for note syntax, a skill Claude Code does not load; harmless, since the syntax it needs is plain Markdown with wiki links | |
| A31 | Wiki and memory | Session retrospective: lessons become issues | pstack `reflect`, `correct`, `principle-encode-lessons-in-structure` | missing | Lessons today end in memory files or nowhere; the plugin's rule is that a lesson becomes a tracker issue | NER-411 |
| A32 | Wiki and memory | Decision trail file | pstack `show-me-your-work` | skip | The issue thread (grill state, plan, spec changes, session summaries) is the trail | |
| A33 | Skills | Writing a skill | superpowers `writing-skills`; superpowers-developing-for-claude-code `developing-claude-code-plugins`, `working-with-claude-code`; Matt Pocock `writing-great-skills`; `write-a-skill`, `find-skills` in `~/.agents/skills`; `skill-creator`; Cursor `/create-skill` | skip | Only this repository writes skills; its rules are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and enforced by the validators | |
| A34 | Skills | Testing a skill: an eval runner and coverage of the core skills | `claude plugin eval` | missing | `validate-evals.ts` checks the shape of two eval files; nothing runs them, and `issue-workflow`, `issue-start` and `issue-close` have none | NER-412 |
| A35 | Cross-cutting | Human documentation | Matt Pocock `edit-article`, `writing-beats`, `writing-fragments`, `writing-shape`; pstack `technical-writing`, `unslop` | have `nerd-documentation-write` | | |

## 4. The nine practices of 2026-10-06, re-rated

| Practice | Decision on 2026-10-06 | Now | What the full list changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| TDD | Own skill `tdd` | have (A20) | Nothing. pstack's `tdd` agrees with the recorded-reason exit (test first only when the test path is cheap) |
| Debugging | Own skill `debug` | missing (A21, NER-405) | Cursor's Debug Mode does the hypotheses-plus-instrumentation loop natively, which confirms the ranked-hypotheses choice; the skill is still needed because Claude Code has nothing alike |
| Subagent dispatch | Own skill `dispatch-agents` | missing (A16, NER-405) | Nothing |
| Grilling | Own skill `grill` | have (A10) | Shipped in 0.49.0 |
| Domain modelling | Own skill `model-domain` | missing (A12, NER-405) | pstack's `principle-model-the-domain` is about code structure, not the glossary; it goes to A13 |
| Review | Own, inside `review-verify` | have (A24) plus missing (A25) | The 2026-10-06 decision read `receiving-code-review` only for the island's own findings. Comments from people and bots on the PR are a separate practice with no owner |
| Planning | Own, in `issue-workflow` | have (A14) | Both hosts have a plan mode; ours stays because the plan has to live on the tracker |
| Verification before completion | Folded into `tdd` and the verification table | have (A22) | Nothing |
| Finishing a branch | Own, `issue-close` | have (A26) plus missing (A27) | The PR body for human reviewers had no row then; pstack's `blast-radius` and the client-repository audience make it one |

## 5. Version drift

What happened: on 2026-10-10 the Claude Code install of the plugin was 0.45.0 while `main` was 0.51.0, six releases behind, and it was updated by hand that day. Sessions in between ran old skill text, and superpowers filled the gaps those versions had, with no signal to the user. The same kind of drift exists on the Cursor side: Cursor loads `~/.agents/skills`, where four plugin skills still sit under their June names (`linear-issue-workflow`, `linear-issue-writer`, `nerdbrain-wiki`, `new-project-workflow`), and the state of the Cursor install itself is tracked in NER-409.

Verdict: missing (A5). Detection belongs to the plugin, not to a person remembering to check, because the plugin is the only party that knows its own version. The mechanism (a session-start check, a `project-continue` step, a `bootstrap-clis` probe) is decided in the gap issue, not here.

## 6. Coverage by skill (table B)

Every skill from the command in section 2, mapped to a row of table A, or marked off-cycle with a reason. A skill can feed a row without being needed by it: the verdict is in table A.
