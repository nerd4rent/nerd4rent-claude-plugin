# nerd4rent-claude-plugin

Open-source Claude Code skills that automate the daily developer workflow at [Nerd4Rent](https://nerd4rent.io).

New here? Start with the [User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md) — what graph engineering is, how this plugin practices it, and how to install and drive it day to day.

## Skills

> **Renamed in 0.20.0:** `linear-issue-writer` → `issue-writer`, `linear-issue-workflow` → `issue-workflow`, `linear-issue-close` → `issue-close`, `linear-continue` → `project-continue`. Update any `nerd4rent:` references in your `CLAUDE.md` and hooks after `/plugin update`.

### `nerd4rent:new-project-workflow`

Bootstraps a new project end-to-end in a single approval:

1. Resolves the project directory (argument or `$PWD`).
2. Initializes git if absent.
3. Scaffolds `README.md` if absent.
4. Creates a GitHub repo with `gh` (public by default, confirm to flip).
5. Creates a matching Linear project via the `linearis` CLI (team picked at runtime).
6. Lets you pick a spec-creating skill: an always-available **inline grilling** interview run by the agent itself, plus whatever external spec skills are installed (e.g. `/to-prd`, `/office-hours`; wrappers like `/grill-me` are marked manual-only).

Trigger phrases: *"new project workflow"*, *"bootstrap project"*, *"start a new project the nerd4rent way"*, or `/nerd4rent:new-project-workflow`.

### `nerd4rent:determine-platform`

Establishes which **tracker** holds the project's issues (Linear, GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Azure DevOps Boards, or none) and which **VCS host** holds its code (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps), and records it — see [Platform config and adapters](#platform-config-and-adapters):

1. Reads what is already recorded: the `## Platform` section of the repo `CLAUDE.md`, then `platform:` on the nerdbrain entity page, then a legacy `linear:` block there.
2. Otherwise infers: the origin remote host names the VCS; an authenticated Linear CLI plus exactly one Linear project named like the repo names the tracker — then it writes without asking.
3. When the answer is ambiguous, asks **one** question: a numbered list of the six tracker + host combinations with a recommendation.
4. Writes the result to both places — replacing only the `## Platform` section of `CLAUDE.md` (a second run leaves no diff), and `platform:` on the entity page in place of the legacy `linear:` — and returns it to the conversation.

Writing that section is allowed at any issue status: it is the one exemption from the "no repo change before In Progress" rule. Trigger: `/determine-platform`, a core skill reporting that no platform is configured, or *"which tracker does this project use"*.

### `nerd4rent:issue-writer`

Creates a **new** Linear issue for the current repo with goals specified clearly enough that the planning agent can build an implementation plan straight from it. Upstream of `issue-workflow`:

1. Resolves the platform (`## Platform` in `CLAUDE.md` → entity page → **delegates to `determine-platform`** when none is configured), then the target team/project, and confirms.
2. Adaptively interviews for missing goals — straight to a draft for small clear tasks, a short one-question-at-a-time interview for vague or multi-part work.
3. Drafts the issue from an adaptive template (full vs minimal) and gates the Linear write on your approval.
4. Decomposes the work: a checklist in the body by default, or **real Linear sub-issues** (parent + children via `--parent-ticket`) when the topic plainly splits into stages — and you can force or decline the split.
5. Creates the issue **in Backlog** (explicit `--status Backlog`), then offers an optional **inline grilling session** (one question at a time, a recommended answer with each, facts checked by the agent, only decisions asked) that can sharpen the description or split the topic into sub-issues.
6. Prints the new issue ID and hands off to the status-driven flow: type the issue ID in a new session/message to start planning with `issue-workflow`.

Uses the `linearis` CLI (see Requirements). Trigger: intent to create a new issue/task with no existing ID — *"utwórz/stwórz/dodaj/zgłoś issue"*, *"create issue"*, *"new task"*.

### `nerd4rent:issue-workflow`

A mandatory **status-driven** workflow for working a Linear issue by ID (e.g. `KAM-145`). The issue's Linear status is the single source of truth — you steer by changing the status, the agent never asks you to "confirm the plan" in chat:

1. Fetches the issue (`linearis issues read <ID>`) at the start of every turn and dispatches on status — also when a bare issue ID is typed into a fresh session.
2. **Backlog/Todo** → drafts an implementation plan (for ambiguous requirements, first offers an inline grilling session with an ADR/glossary docs discipline), posts it as a `## Implementation plan` comment, sets the status to Todo, and ends the turn with no instructions.
3. **In Progress** (set manually by you = plan approved) → starts implementation by delegating to **`nerd4rent:issue-start`** (below): branch from the Linear `branchName`, empty commit, push, **draft PR with magic words** (`Fixes TEAM-123`) so the Linear↔GitHub integration closes the issue on merge; then offers an implementation mode (superpowers / Matt Pocock skills / plain agent — whichever is available).
4. After implementation or on **In Review** → offers a code-review menu (superpowers / Matt Pocock / review it yourself); never offers to merge or close on its own.
5. Close-out on request: delegates to **`nerd4rent:issue-close`** (below) to merge and finish the issue.
6. Posts a `## Session summary` comment after every working session, and in the same step records a one-line **checkpoint** (date, issue, status, branch, HEAD, next step) under `## Checkpoints` on the project's nerdbrain entity page — the entry `project-continue` reads back later; skipped silently when the vault is unreachable.

Uses the `linearis` CLI (syntax proven in the skill's own CLI reference). Trigger: any Linear issue ID with intent to plan or implement (incl. Polish *zaplanuj*, *zrealizuj*, *napraw*).

### `nerd4rent:issue-start`

The mirror of `issue-close` at the other end of an issue: a deliberately **mechanical, lightweight** Start for an issue the user has already moved to In Progress — purely procedural with explicit commands, no questions and no multi-step reasoning, pinned to **Haiku** via `model: haiku`. Invoked by `issue-workflow`'s Start step, or directly:

1. Reads the issue (`linearis issues read <ID> --fields identifier,title,branchName,state.name`) and stops unless it is **In Progress** — the same approval gate `issue-workflow` enforces.
2. Requires a clean checkout on `main`/`master`; on any other branch or with leftover changes it stops and reports (branching from another issue branch is `issue-workflow`'s decision, not the chain's).
3. Creates the branch from the Linear `branchName`, makes the empty start commit (`Rozpoczęcie prac nad <ID>`, no co-author) and pushes with upstream.
4. Detects GitHub vs GitLab from the origin remote and opens a **draft** PR/MR (`gh pr create --draft` / `glab mr create --draft`) whose body starts with `Fixes <ID>`, so the Linear integration tracks it and auto-closes the issue on merge.

On any error (branch already exists, push rejected, missing `gh`/`glab`) it stops and reports rather than improvising. Uses the `linearis` CLI. Trigger: intent to start an issue that is In Progress — *"zacznij"*, *"rozpocznij"*, *"start NER-123"*, *"open the PR for"*.

### `nerd4rent:issue-close`

A deliberately **mechanical, lightweight** close-out for a finished issue — purely procedural with explicit commands and no multi-step reasoning. It pins itself to **Haiku** via a `model: haiku` frontmatter field (a Claude Code skill extension; other agents ignore the field), so the close-out runs cheap regardless of the session model. Invoked by `issue-workflow`'s close-out phase, or directly:

1. Commits any leftover changes (repo convention: Polish, noun-form message, no co-author) — or skips if the tree is clean.
2. Pushes the branch (sets upstream if needed).
3. Detects GitHub vs GitLab from the origin remote and merges the PR/MR with a merge commit (`gh pr merge --merge` / `glab mr merge`; marks a draft PR ready first).
4. Switches the local checkout to the PR/MR's **base** branch (read from the PR/MR, not assumed to be `main`) and pulls.
5. Sets the Linear issue to **Done** (`linearis issues update <ID> --status Done`) — deterministic and covering GitLab, where there's no Linear↔GitHub auto-close.

On any error (e.g. merge conflict, missing `gh`/`glab`) it stops and reports rather than improvising. Uses the `linearis` CLI. Trigger: intent to close/merge/finish an issue — *"domknij"*, *"zamknij"*, *"zmerguj i zamknij"*, *"close out"*, *"merge and close"*.

### `nerd4rent:project-continue`

Answers "where are we" for the current project in one step, after you switch to it — on this machine or another one — instead of re-investigating issues and the repo from scratch:

1. Reads the newest entry of `## Checkpoints` **directly from the entity page file** (the section is lazy, so the SessionStart inject never carries it).
2. Verifies it against git (`git fetch --prune`, then four cases checked in order against the local and remote branch tips, stopping at the first that fires: hash unknown after the fetch = commit never pushed from the other machine; branch gone = merged or lost, decided against the default branch; hash no longer an ancestor = history rewritten; commits after the hash = work without a checkpoint) and against Linear (`linearis issues read <ID> --fields identifier,title,state.name` vs the recorded status).
3. Reports the checkpoint, the git and Linear verdicts, the project's active issues (`Todo / In Progress / In Review`, team and project from the page frontmatter), and one hint line: type the issue ID to resume it with `issue-workflow` — it never enters the workflow on its own.
4. On drift, **asks** before recording a new checkpoint; without a yes nothing is written. With no checkpoint at all it establishes the state from Linear and git, shows it, and records the first entry. With no entity page (`tier=none`) it reports only.

The entry format and the *Prepend, capped* (10 newest) write mode live in `nerdbrain-wiki`. Uses `linearis` (read-only) and `git`. Trigger: *"gdzie jesteśmy"*, *"na czym stanęliśmy"*, *"kontynuuj projekt"*, *"continue"*, *"where were we"*.

### `nerd4rent:nerdbrain-wiki`

The HOW for maintaining a personal Obsidian "second brain" — one entity page per project at `5-wiki/entities/projects/<slug>.md`. It carries:

- Section update modes (Edit/rewrite vs Append/chronological vs Prepend-capped vs flag-staleness).
- The `## Checkpoints` section: a one-line entry format (date, issue, Linear status, branch, HEAD, next step), newest first, capped at 10 — the project's resumable state written by `issue-workflow` and read by `project-continue`.
- The filesystem write pattern (`Read`/`Edit`/`Write` on the vault path; propagation is Obsidian Sync, not this skill's concern).
- Graph recall on-demand: following `related:`/`[[links]]` (direct `Read`) and vault search via `nerd4rent:nerdbrain-search`, with hard context limits — no speculative reading of the graph.
- Index (`index.md`) and log (`log.md`) maintenance steps.
- A bundled `entity-page-template.md` to scaffold a brand-new page.

The *when to write* triggers and hard safety rules stay in the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; this skill is invoked once a write is warranted. Trigger: about to create or update a nerdbrain wiki entity page.

### `nerd4rent:nerdbrain-search`

`rg`-based recipes for searching the nerdbrain vault (`~/obsidian/nerdbrain/5-wiki/`) — the read path behind `nerdbrain-wiki`'s Graph recall step (ADR-0001: filesystem+`rg`, no CLI abstraction):

1. **Phrase in vault** — `rg -il` for filenames, `rg -i -n -C2` for context snippets.
2. **Outgoing `[[links]]`** — extract link/embed targets from a page.
3. **Backlinks** — find every page linking to a given slug (handles `[[slug|alias]]` and `![[slug]]`).
4. **1-hop graph** — outgoing links plus backlinks for an entity page, composed from recipes 2 and 3.

Limits on how much to read (max related pages, snippet caps) stay with the calling skill. Trigger: another skill's recall step needs to search the vault or follow links.

### `nerd4rent:bootstrap-clis`

Brings this machine to the CLI state the skills in this repo require:

1. Probes every entry declared in `cli-dependencies.json` (currently `node`, `linearis`, `gh`, `glab`, `rg`, `git`). A missing `glab` only matters on GitLab-hosted repos.
2. Installs or updates whatever is missing or outdated — download with checksum verification, or `npm install --global` for entries declaring the `npm` method.
3. Hands back the authentication steps only a human can complete — it never runs `auth login` flows itself.

Trigger: `/nerd4rent:bootstrap-clis`, on a freshly set up machine, or when a skill fails because a command like `linearis`, `gh`, or `rg` is missing or too old.

## Platform config and adapters

Every skill that talks to a tracker or a VCS host reads the project's **platform config** first — one YAML object kept as a `## Platform` section in the repo's committed `CLAUDE.md` (so it travels with the repo into every worktree) and mirrored as `platform:` on the nerdbrain entity page:

````markdown
## Platform

```yaml
tracker: linear
vcs: github
linear:
  team: NER
  project: <project-uuid>
github:
  owner: nerd4rent
  repo: nerd4rent-claude-plugin
```
````

`tracker` is one of `linear`, `github`, `gitlab`, `ado`, `none`; `vcs` one of `github`, `gitlab`, `ado`. The shape is the `PlatformConfig` schema in `workflow-graph.json`. `determine-platform` writes it; an entity page with only the older `linear: {team, project}` block keeps working as an alias.

The commands themselves live in **adapter files**, one per platform per axis:

| Axis | Adapter files | Required sections |
|---|---|---|
| tracker | `adapters/trackers/linear.md` | `CLI`, `Issue ID`, `Operations`, `URL`, `Statuses` |
| VCS host | `adapters/vcs/github.md`, `adapters/vcs/gitlab.md` | `CLI`, `Detection`, `Operations`, `Magic words`, `URL` |

Skills never quote a command: they name an **operation ID** (`issue.set-status`, `pr.merge`, …) and look it up in the adapter's `## Operations` table, read through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. The `adapters` block of `workflow-graph.json` declares each axis's sections and operation IDs, and `node scripts/validate-workflow-graph.ts` rejects an adapter that misses one, repeats one, lists an undeclared one, or is named outside the config enum. A configured platform with no adapter file yet makes the skill stop with "adapter not available yet" — it never falls back to Linear. See [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-platform-adapters-as-reference-files.md).

## Plugin agents

Four read-only agents ship in `agents/` and register as `nerd4rent:<name>`
in the same registry the Agent tool uses. They exist for the islands' mechanical
roles — reading a diff or a source and returning data under a schema — so those
roles run with a structural tool whitelist (no Edit, Write or NotebookEdit; no
ToolSearch, so no MCP) instead of the default workflow subagent with full tools,
and, where the role allows it, on a cheaper model than the session's. The islands select them per `agent()` call via
`agentType`; the contract in `workflow-graph.json` is unchanged, because which
agent runs a role is an execution parameter, not topology.

| Agent | Model | Tools | Called by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nerd4rent:review-mapper` | Sonnet | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Skill | the four axis mappers of `review-verify` |
| `nerd4rent:review-sceptic` | `inherit` (the session model) | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Skill | the three sceptics per finding of `review-verify` |
| `nerd4rent:review-synthesizer` | Haiku | Read | the summary writer of `review-verify` |
| `nerd4rent:plan-gatherer` | Sonnet | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Skill; preloads `nerd4rent:nerdbrain-search` | the five gatherers of `plan-context-fanout` |

The sceptics of the review island keep the **session model** on purpose
(`model: inherit`): they are the only quality gate, and their "when uncertain,
refute" rule on a weaker model would refute everything. What they gain from a
dedicated agent is the tool whitelist alone — the default workflow subagent was
observed running `git checkout` in the repo during a review, which the
whitelist plus the agent's read-only rule now rule out. The agents are not meant for direct delegation
— their descriptions say so — and `plugin.json` does not list them, since the
`agents` manifest field would replace the auto-discovered directory rather than
add to it.

## Workflow topology

The skills above are not a loose bag: they form the **issue lifecycle axis**,
written down as a contract in [`workflow-graph.json`](workflow-graph.json) and
enforced by `node scripts/validate-workflow-graph.ts` (tests:
`node --test scripts/**/*.test.ts`). The contract declares, per node, which
skill runs it, what schema each edge carries, which gates guard it, what happens
on failure, and how wide it may fan out (`budget.maxWidth`, an integer from 1 to
the runtime's cap of 16). Two nodes sharing an upstream is what "these may run
at once" looks like — `wiki-recall` and `plan-context-fanout` are both plan-phase
branches off `issue-write`, split into separate nodes only because a node belongs
to exactly one skill. See
[ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-workflow-graph-contract.md) for why the contract and
the runtime are two different artifacts.

Gates and frozen rules are data, not prose. Every **irreversible** action on
the axis — writing the issue to Linear (`issue-write`), pushing commits
(`implement`), merging and setting Done (`close`), writing the vault
(`wiki-write`) — is marked `irreversible: true` and must sit behind a gate.
A gate is one of two kinds with a closed mechanism vocabulary the validator
enforces: a `decision` gate is the human's call (`tracker-status` or
`chat-approval` — the Linear status is the only carrier of acceptance), a
`deny` gate is a hard stop that never asks (`pretooluse-hook` or
`settings-deny`). The **`frozenRules`** registry makes the invariants
first-class: a gate's `rule` field points into it, a deny gate exists only to
enforce one, and a rule no gate points to is rejected — so a dangerous
transition is unreachable, not merely "usually asked about". A rule's rare
legitimate exception is data too: `exemptions` names the node, the narrow scope
and the reason (today only `platform-determine` writing the `## Platform`
section of `CLAUDE.md`). Human gates sit
on the boundaries between workflows, never inside them.

Every registry entry carries its **schema body** — the JSON Schema the payload on
that edge is checked against — and the body has two consumers, which is what keeps
the shape defined once instead of twice. `node scripts/render-templates.ts`
renders it into the templates the skills ship (`plan-template.md`,
`issue-template.md`, `session-summary-template.md`), and inside a workflow island
the same body is what `agent({schema})` enforces at runtime, inlined verbatim.
Those three files are generated artifacts: change a
section by editing the schema, and a hand edit reddens the drift test. A body is
also self-contained — a `$ref` may only point into the entry's own `$defs` — because
a workflow script has to inline it verbatim. None of this ever becomes a
precondition: a session without the workflow runtime fills the same generated
template in prose, exactly as before.

Two islands are real. `workflows/plan-context-fanout.js` runs the plan-phase
fan-out (trigger `/nerd4rent:plan-context-fanout`, or `Workflow({name: "nerd4rent:plan-context-fanout", args})`
during development). One script realises both plan-phase workflow nodes — the
contract's `script` binding on `wiki-recall` and `plan-context-fanout` points at
the same file — spawning five concurrent gatherers (repo layout, conventions,
prior plans, related Linear issues, nerdbrain vault) and reducing their output
deterministically into `PlanContext` + `ProjectContext`. The five gatherers
run as the `nerd4rent:plan-gatherer` agent (see [Plugin agents](#plugin-agents)).
The binding also arms
the drift check in the omission direction: every `out` schema of a bound node
must be inlined in its script (rule 17) and every inline body must be a
strict-JSON literal deep-equal to the registry body (rule 18).

The second island, `workflows/review-verify.js`, runs the review phase as
map → reduce → verify → synthesize: one mapper per review axis
(spec-compliance, repo-standards, correctness-regressions, security), a
deterministic reducer (schema-invalid records dropped, dedup by `file:line`
with the most severe finding winning the anchor, severity sort, cap 12), then
adversarial verification — 3 sceptics per
finding, each prompted to refute it, 2 or more refutations out of 3 reject it
— and a synthesizer that writes only the summary while the reducer assembles
the findings verbatim. The mappers run as `nerd4rent:review-mapper`, the
sceptics as `nerd4rent:review-sceptic` on the session model, and the
synthesizer as `nerd4rent:review-synthesizer` (see
[Plugin agents](#plugin-agents)). Rejections and
overflow are counted in the required `ReviewFindings.stats`, so degradation is
visible, never silent.

The axis measures itself **passively**: a figure is collected only when it is a
by-product of a run that happens anyway, and it is stored only where that run's
result already lands — a Linear comment. Three of them. The **verifier
rejection rate** (`rejected / (verified + rejected)` from `ReviewFindings.stats`)
says whether adversarial verification earns its latency: read over the last ~5
runs, below 10% the verifier is decoration and above 50% the reviewers are
ill-defined — the thresholds live in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). The **node
failure rate** comes from the `gaps` both islands report, plus
`stats.unverifiedOverflow`. **Fan-out effectiveness** is the optional
`PlanContext.stats`: per gatherer, how many items it returned and how many it
was the first to contribute, so a gatherer stuck near zero across runs becomes
a removal candidate. The plan island's figures reach Linear through the
optional `metrics` section of the session summary. Nothing here needs CI, a
telemetry channel or a clock — the one candidate that did, critical-path
length, was dropped rather than deferred.

Not every skill is a node. `project-continue`, like `bootstrap-clis`, is an
entry point *from outside* the axis: it answers "where
were we" by reading the `## Checkpoints` entry that the `session-summary` →
`wiki-write` edge already produces, and it asks the user before writing —
which makes it conversational by nature and rules out an island. Registering it
as a node would mean inventing a `dependsOn` and an edge schema for a step that
consumes an existing edge's output instead of extending the axis, so the
contract stays at 10 nodes.

The axis is an **island graph**, not one graph end to end. The Claude Code
workflow runtime takes no mid-run user input, so every step that needs a human
— the grilling session, the "user sets In Progress" gate, the review menu —
stays in the conversational main agent, and only the wide, independent,
human-free stretches become workflow islands:

```
[main agent, conversational, status-driven]
  ├─ workflow island: plan-context fanout           ← built: workflows/plan-context-fanout.js
  ├─ [GATE: the human sets In Progress in Linear]   ← outside the graph, necessarily
  ├─ start: a chain, pinned to Haiku, no workflow    ← first half of `implement`: issue-start
  ├─ implementation (sequential, conversational)
  ├─ workflow island: review map → reduce → verify → synthesize   ← built: workflows/review-verify.js
  └─ close-out: a chain, pinned to Haiku, no workflow
```

Chains sit at both ends of the axis: `issue-start` opens the branch and the
draft PR, `issue-close` merges and finishes. Neither is a graph node of its
own — Start is the first half of `implement`, behind the same `tracker-status`
gate, and a separate node would only duplicate that gate.

| Node | Skill | Phase | Runtime | Edge in → out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `platform-determine` | `determine-platform` | write | conversational | — → `PlatformConfig` |
| `issue-write` | `issue-writer` | write | conversational | `PlatformConfig` → `IssueSpec` |
| `wiki-recall` | `nerdbrain-search` | plan | **workflow** | `IssueSpec` → `ProjectContext` |
| `plan-context-fanout` | `issue-workflow` | plan | **workflow** | `IssueSpec` → `PlanContext` |
| `plan-draft` | `issue-workflow` | plan | conversational | `PlanContext`, `ProjectContext` → `ImplementationPlan` |
| `implement` | `issue-workflow` | implement | conversational | `ImplementationPlan` → `ChangeSet` |
| `session-summary` | `issue-workflow` | implement | conversational | `ChangeSet` → `SessionSummary` |
| `review-menu` | `issue-workflow` | review | conversational | `ChangeSet` → `ReviewRequest` |
| `review-verify` | `issue-workflow` | review | **workflow** | `ReviewRequest` → `ReviewFindings` |
| `close` | `issue-close` | close | chain | `ReviewFindings` → `MergedBranch` |
| `wiki-write` | `nerdbrain-wiki` | wiki | chain | `SessionSummary` → `EntityPageUpdate` |

Degradation runs on two tracks, and both end in the same place — the sequence
the skills already describe in prose:

- **Other agents** (Cursor, Copilot, …) have no `Workflow` tool at all; they
  read the topology as documentation and run the axis sequentially.
- **Claude Code with workflows unavailable** — below v2.1.154, on a plan that
  does not include them, or switched off via `"disableWorkflows": true`, the
  *Dynamic workflows* toggle in `/config`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WORKFLOWS=1`
  — falls back the same way, so an island is always an optimization, never a
  precondition.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add this marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nerd4rent/nerd4rent-claude-plugin
/plugin install nerd4rent@nerd4rent-claude-plugin
```

### Other agents (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, …)

The skills follow the shared [Agent Skills specification](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills), so the [`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) can install them into 70+ coding agents:

```bash
# Install all skills globally into your detected agent(s)
npx skills add nerd4rent/nerd4rent-claude-plugin -g

# Or target a specific agent and/or skill
npx skills add nerd4rent/nerd4rent-claude-plugin -g -a cursor -s '*'

# Keep them current
npx skills update
```

Cursor reads global skills from `~/.agents/skills/` (and `~/.cursor/skills/`); the CLI installs there automatically. Restart the agent after installing.

## Requirements

- `git`
- `gh` (GitHub CLI), authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- `glab` (GitLab CLI), authenticated (`glab auth status`) — only for GitLab-hosted repos
- Node.js ≥ 22 (with npm)
- `linearis` CLI (`npm i -g linearis`), authenticated with a personal API key from Linear Settings → API (`LINEAR_API_TOKEN` or `linearis auth login`); the Linear skills degrade gracefully if absent

## Releasing

Two manifests carry a version, and they move together:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `metadata.version`

The installed plugin version comes from `plugin.json`. Bumping it is what forces Claude Code to refresh its `cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/` copy — an unchanged number makes `/plugin update` a no-op even when `main` has moved on. `marketplace.json` versions the marketplace itself and does not drive that cache, but the two numbers have matched for every release; a mismatch publishes an inconsistent manifest. Keep them equal — `node scripts/validate-manifests.ts` checks it and exits non-zero when they drift.

Merging to `main` does not update anyone's install on its own: the local marketplace clone is only refreshed by `/plugin marketplace update <marketplace>`, followed by `/plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace>`.
